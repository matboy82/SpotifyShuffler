# Development Practices and Patterns

## Development

### General
- **Practices**:
    - Avoid duplication of code as possible, check all other areas of codebase for similar code or logic and actively suggest refactoring to avoid duplication
    - Only make requested changes, if you have a recommendation ask before making the change with a simple summary
    - When fixing an issue or bug do not introduce a new pattern until you've exhausted other possibilities for the existing implementation
    - Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code outside of test files

- **Patterns**:
    - Component Driven Design
    - Reactive Programming
    - Inversion of Control
    - Dependency Injection
    - Atomic Design 
    - Single Responsibility Principle
    - SOLID Principles
    - Test Driven Development
    - Real Time Event based Architecture
    - Event Sourcing
    - CQRS
    - Domain Driven Design
